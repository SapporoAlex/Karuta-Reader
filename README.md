# Karuta Reader
A web app best used on mobile, it allows 2 people to play hiragana karuta without needing an extra person to read out the prompt cards.

## Usage
1. Load the page from https://sapporoalex.github.io/Karuta-Reader/
   on your mobile.
2. Lay out the 44 hiragana cards onto a flat surface between the players.
3. Take turns pressing the next (次の札) button to begin the audio prompt.
4. Players compete to touch the corresponding card before the other players. The first to touch the card, adds it to their card pile.
5. After all hiragana cards are claimed, the player with the most wins.

## UI
The simple UI consists of
- new game (新しき遊戯) button at the top that reshuffles the deck and starts from 44 cards
- next (次の札) button to draw the next card
- repeat (繰り返し) button to play the audio prompt again
- stop (止む) button to reveal the correct hiragana that was prompted. Press this after a player claims a card.
- a red circle in the center that displays the correct hiragana after pressing stop
- black text below stating the remaining number of karuta cards
